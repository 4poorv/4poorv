### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Reflecting on the last decade of shaping petabyte-scale data platforms, my journey in data engineering has been profound and transformative. I've mastered the craft of transforming vast silos of data into high-quality datasets, laying the foundation for what I see as the next frontier: the era of cognitive AI.

In the coming decade, my mission is to architect solutions that will serve as the lifeblood for these emerging AI systems, capable of reasoning, understanding, and interacting with the world in ways we are just beginning to imagine.

And, I believe these systems will redefine our understanding of technology, society, and intelligence itself.
